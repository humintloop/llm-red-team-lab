# EU AI Act High-Risk Readiness Notes

These notes explain how ELICIT uses EU AI Act references. They are readiness indicators only, not legal conclusions.

## Working Profile

ELICIT uses a **SaaS / Critical Digital Infrastructure Readiness** profile for Akamai-like organizations:

- AI-enabled SaaS
- cybersecurity products and operations
- edge, cloud, network, or critical digital infrastructure services
- LLM features that may support analysis, summarization, decision support, incident response, or operational workflows

## Scope Caveat

The EU AI Act high-risk analysis depends on the actual AI system, intended purpose, user role, jurisdiction, and deployment context. For critical infrastructure, the lab treats high-risk readiness as most relevant when an AI system is used as a safety component in the management or operation of critical digital infrastructure or another high-risk area.

Cybersecurity-only components are not automatically safety components. ELICIT therefore uses careful wording such as:

- "EU AI Act readiness relevance"
- "where applicable and in scope"
- "potential readiness gap"
- "not a compliance conclusion"

## Articles Used in ELICIT Reports

- **Article 9:** risk management system
- **Article 12:** record-keeping and logging
- **Article 14:** human oversight
- **Article 15:** accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity
- **Article 17:** quality management system
- **Article 72:** post-market monitoring
- **Annex III.2:** critical infrastructure category where a safety-component use case is in scope

## How Findings Map to Readiness

When an attack succeeds or partially succeeds, ELICIT frames the result as evidence that a control may be weak, missing, or degrading. The finding record should show:

- what was tested
- what happened
- why the secure behavior was expected
- which project-defined controls were implicated
- which ISO/EU readiness topics may need evidence
- what should be mitigated
- how to retest

This keeps the tool focused on test-to-evidence rather than red-team theater.
