# Source Ledger

This ledger records the sources used for ELICIT mappings and control-language decisions.
It is a traceability aid, not a legal or audit conclusion.

## Mapping Types

- **Official source:** language or taxonomy maintained by the named organization.
- **Direct mapping:** the source explicitly connects the concept or taxonomy item.
- **Inferred mapping:** the lab maps source concepts to project-defined controls based on functional relevance.
- **Project-defined control:** control language created for this lab and intended to be replaced by organization-specific controls later.
- **Implementation guidance:** practical security or assurance language derived from multiple sources and local design decisions.

## Project-Defined Mapping Notes

- The ELICIT controls are **not** MITRE, OWASP, NIST, ISO, CSA, or EU AI Act controls.
- MITRE and OWASP entries are used as source-grounded risk and technique references.
- Mappings from MITRE/OWASP entries to `LLM-*` controls are project-defined and should be treated as inferred unless a future source explicitly defines the relationship.
- ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF, and EU AI Act references in the app are relevance indicators only. They are not compliance determinations.
- ISO/IEC 42001 section 9 references are used to frame performance-evaluation evidence: monitoring and measurement, internal audit, and management review.
- EU AI Act references use a SaaS / critical digital infrastructure readiness lens for Akamai-like providers. High-risk status depends on actual system role, intended purpose, jurisdiction, and whether the AI system is used as a safety component or falls into another high-risk category.
- Cybersecurity-only components are not automatically treated as EU AI Act safety components.
- The local custom technique `AML.T0051.DC` is not an official MITRE ATLAS technique. It is a local variant for delimiter-confusion testing under the broader prompt-injection family.

## Review Checklist

Before publishing a report or demo:

- Confirm source dates are current enough for the purpose.
- Separate directly sourced taxonomy language from project-defined control language.
- Avoid legal, audit, certification, or regulatory conclusions.
- Keep sensitive evidence minimized and sanitized.
- Label local/custom variants clearly.
